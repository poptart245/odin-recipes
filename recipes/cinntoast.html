        <h3>Description</h3>
            <p>Cinnamon toast is one of the easiest recipes out there, but I always
                find it so satisfying. It brings back memories of summertime mornings
                watching tv with my sisters and eating our way through the pantry
                out of pure boredom. We would make cinnamon toast often because it was
                so simple we didn't have to ask mom to help us.</p>
            <p>The warmth of the melted butter mixed with the sweetness of the sugar
                and the earthiness of the cinnamon powder create a delicate flavor that is
                often overlooked in store-bought cinnamon rolls and similar such items,
                and for me that is what gives the nostalgia that extra kick in this quick
                breakfast dish.</p>

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>2 slices bread (your choice of type; I like split top honey wheat)</li>
                <li>2 teaspoons butter</li>
                <li>1 teaspoon ground cinnamon</li>
                <li>2 tablespoons white sugar</li>
            </ul>

        <h3>Steps</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Put slices of bread into the toaster on the medium-high setting
                    (depending on your toaster) and toast</li>
                <li>Remove toast from toaster and butter one side</li>
                <li>Let butter melt slightly, then sprinkle liberally with sugar and
                    cinnamon powder.</li>
                <li>Once cool, enjoy with a glass of milk or fruit juice.</li>
            </ol>
